*The above demonstrates client based scaling + render distances, but has issues w/ chunk communication and collision*

Currently has functionality for:
- Basic player functionality
- Multiplayer connection
- Tilesets/Tilemaps
- Spriting/Spritesheets
- Animations
- Collisions
- Screen Scaling
- Render Distance Management
- Chunk Generation (Broken)
